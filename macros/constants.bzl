# Use this tag on tests that require multiple CPU cores to prevent server overcomit
# Implementation note:
# It will reserve 4 CPU cores for that test, thus ensuring at most 2 threadpool-using
# tests to run in parallel on a 8-core machine. Our CI runners are generally configured
# to have 6, 8, or 10 CPU cores, so using 4 is a reasonable choice, given that Bazel
# does not allow us to specify "half of the available cores" or similar.
# See https://bazel.build/reference/test-encyclopedia#other-resources for details.
